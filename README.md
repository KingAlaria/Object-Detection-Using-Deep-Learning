About dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale 28x28 pixel clothing images. Each image is associated with a label as shown in this table.
70,000 grayscale photos of ten different categories of fashion items—7,000 photos in each—are included in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The pictures are 28 by 28 pixels in size, and each pixel shows its own brightness; brighter pixels are represented by greater numbers.

A common benchmark for machine learning methods, the MNIST handwritten digit dataset may be swapped out for the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset presents greater challenges than the MNIST dataset, though, because it can be harder to tell apart individual fashion items.

A useful dataset for testing machine learning algorithms on picture classification problems is Fashion-MNIST. It's also a fantastic option for creating and testing fresh machine learning algorithms for categorising images.
